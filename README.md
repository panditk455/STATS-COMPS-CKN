Test Awareness/Hawthorne Effect, with an emphasis on simulating different item banks and test design 
Cici, Kritika, Nicholas


Research and implement 3 methods for computing confidence intervals for error rates (e.g. nonparametric bootstrap, clustered bootstrap, etc.) 
Simulate response data under different assumptions about the difficulty of the item bank (e.g. lots of low-quality items compared to very few) 
Repeat simulations with Hawthorne effect included
Measure the performance of the confidence interval procedures on the simulated data and make a recommendation for black box studies to use in the future
